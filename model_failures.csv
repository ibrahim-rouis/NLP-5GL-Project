"I enjoy Italian food and great pasta, but I feel like this just wasn't the restaurant for me.

Came here with a group of friends to enjoy dinner and ahead of the visit I scanned the menu and was a little disappointed to see that the menu was what I like to call ""one note"".

Italy is a beautiful country with a diverse cuisine, but this menu really just hits on the overly heavy dishes typically enjoyed by Americans. I was surprised to see it was nearly absent of center plate, proteins, grilled items and even vegetables, aside from a few salads.

We started with a number of appetizers, almost all of which were fried, including the artichoke hearts, calamari, and arancini. All of them were nicely fried, not greasy and crispy on the outside, but in general, I felt this was pretty expected.

We then ordered pizzas and pasta dishes, and I'll say that the pasta was quite good. I chose the sacchetti with Gorgonzola to was very delicious, with the perfect al dente texture too. All of my dining companions agreed as well. There were other solid pasta choices too, so if this is what you're after, I'd definitely visit. We all also really loved the gluten free pasta with house sausage too, and it was nice that they had this as an option.

The other standout entree was the chicken parmigiana, which had great texture and a delightful tangy tomato sauce that made you want to lick the plate clean.

Pizzas were all tasty too, but after fried apps and pasta, it was tough to really enjoy them.

All in all the food was tasty and great for a group, with wonderful service. Cocktails were def very mid imho, and I did expect better from a restaurant in SF.","Positive","Negative"
"This place can get really busy, so plan accordingly. It's tucked away in a small street in San Francisco, best way to get there could be Uber or plan to park your car and block or two away.
French inspired with with a hint of San Francisco local and a dash of Vietnamese.","Positive","Neutral"
