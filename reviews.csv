"The food was incredible. Not only did Nomi, our lovely server, make the best suggestions she was the best at making us feel welcomed.

I ordered two of their specials (the ravioli) and the salmon.

The food always hits here and setting was quiet and comforting.

It allowed me to celebrate my B' Day with my twin brother.",Positive
"This was my first time eating at Fog Harbor Fish House. Upon walking in the restaurant, there is a fair buzz of noise level of customer conversations and music in the background. The views are spectacular from the second floor location. The layout of the booth seating and dining tables is well appointed.

My waiter greeted me after about 10 minutes which seemed a little longer than expected. He was very pleasant, asked if I wanted water, I gave my order, and he followed up with my drink and sourdough bread.

I ended up ordering Cioppino. This was a generous amount of seafood in an excellent tomato based stew. I thought all the seafood was cooked perfect and was the perfect amount for one person.

I was overall happy with my meal and with the ambience and service. I look forward to coming back.",Positive
"We had reservations here on a Saturday night which I definitely recommend since the restaurant was pretty full. The interior is really nice with a view of the bay and an upscale but comfortable environment. The service here is pretty decent, we were checked on multiple times and the server was friendly too.

The Caesar salad was my least favorite thing, it lacked dressing and croutons. Everything else here was really good though, I had the seasonal miso salmon which is the best salmon I've ever had! The miso dressing wasn't too sweet or overpowering and paired perfectly with the bok choy. The lobster roll was nice and buttery. The substituted side of sautéed vegetables was garlicky and satisfying. The clam chowder was also a 5/5 for me. Overall this is a nice seafood dinner spot with a view, and a nice dinner choice on the pier.",Positive
"While the setting is magical and its decked out for the holidays. Our sever was horrible, and dishes were (as expected) insanely overpriced. Pasta was dry, salad was plain, soup was lacking flavor. Fish from fish and chips was top notch. We had to get up twice to ask for ice at the bar. Just because we aren't ordering rounds of drinks, Carlos, doesn't mean we don't deserve attention. Annoyed to have spent hard earned money here.",Negative
"Plenty of sourdough rolls. Near the end of the day, two appetizers weren't available.

We were a large party. Food came out quickly. Clam chowder was good but too many potatoes. Crab was OK.

Server was friendly and attentive.",Positive
"This is still one of the better clam chowders I've had in SF. Rather than sit at the Wipeout bar downstairs, I decided to sit in the main restaurant at their bar for lunch. I started with a Fog Harbor lager, and then enjoyed my lunch combo of clam chowder in a bread bowl with side of Caesar salad. Both were delicious and very filling. Service was friendly, and about what you'd expect at a bar. Views in the restaurant are fantastic.",Positive
"The service and ambiance of this restaurant are great. The warm atmosphere and the nice fireplace with all of the beautiful decor (they had Christmas decor when we went) really make this a beautiful restaurant.

Although the food was also good, the portion sizes are so small for how much you pay. We wanted a light dinner and opted to share an appetizer (fried calamari) and an entree grilled chicken and shrimp), but we paid a lot more than we wanted to.

We walked here from our hotel in Fisherman's Wharf, so we did not have to deal with parking at all, but since it's on Pier 39, plan accordingly. Ubering or parking at a paid parking lot are the best options, unless you're walking distance from the restaurant.",Positive
"We've eaten here a few times before and it was never terrible, but this visit completely changed our minds. We came near the end of the day with a reservation for 8, and things went downhill right away. The hostess kept asking how many people were in our party, even though we told her 8 several times. It honestly felt like having a larger group was a problem for them. We ordered the baked oysters and they were disgusting. They were absolutely spoiled, and I had to spit mine out because I truly felt like I might get sick. The steak wasn't any better. It was mushy and had no flavor at all. The restaurant was packed, and you could tell they couldn't keep up with the quality of their food or service. The men's restroom was also dirty, which just added to the bad experience.
We've had this place multiple times , but it only takes one really bad experience to make you never want to come back. We definitely won't.",Negative
"TERRIBLE SERVICE! We were seated all the way in the back for about 20 minutes and no one came to help us out. We flagged them down multiple times and they looked and ignored us. I understand that they're busy, but at least have a server come and ask if we need any drinks, but nope completely ignored us so we walked right out",Negative
"The service was excellent & Million was very attentive. Unfortunately, the seafood risotto special was pretty terrible. It was pretty flavorless & the rice was not cooked properly. Risotto should be al dente but not crunchy. It's like the chef precooked it but forgot to finish it off. Probably the worse risotto I've ever had.",Negative
The food was amazing and came in big portions. The food also arrived fast for how busy it was. The service is fast and the wait staff are very nice. The restaurant is very cozy and is nicely decorated for the holiday season. Our table was also next to the window and the view was really pretty!,Positive
