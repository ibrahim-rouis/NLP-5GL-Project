"The food was incredible. Not only did Nomi, our lovely server, make the best suggestions she was the best at making us feel welcomed.

I ordered two of their specials (the ravioli) and the salmon.

The food always hits here and setting was quiet and comforting.

It allowed me to celebrate my B' Day with my twin brother.",Positive
"This was my first time eating at Fog Harbor Fish House. Upon walking in the restaurant, there is a fair buzz of noise level of customer conversations and music in the background. The views are spectacular from the second floor location. The layout of the booth seating and dining tables is well appointed.

My waiter greeted me after about 10 minutes which seemed a little longer than expected. He was very pleasant, asked if I wanted water, I gave my order, and he followed up with my drink and sourdough bread.

I ended up ordering Cioppino. This was a generous amount of seafood in an excellent tomato based stew. I thought all the seafood was cooked perfect and was the perfect amount for one person.

I was overall happy with my meal and with the ambience and service. I look forward to coming back.",Positive
"We had reservations here on a Saturday night which I definitely recommend since the restaurant was pretty full. The interior is really nice with a view of the bay and an upscale but comfortable environment. The service here is pretty decent, we were checked on multiple times and the server was friendly too.

The Caesar salad was my least favorite thing, it lacked dressing and croutons. Everything else here was really good though, I had the seasonal miso salmon which is the best salmon I've ever had! The miso dressing wasn't too sweet or overpowering and paired perfectly with the bok choy. The lobster roll was nice and buttery. The substituted side of sautéed vegetables was garlicky and satisfying. The clam chowder was also a 5/5 for me. Overall this is a nice seafood dinner spot with a view, and a nice dinner choice on the pier.",Positive
"While the setting is magical and its decked out for the holidays. Our sever was horrible, and dishes were (as expected) insanely overpriced. Pasta was dry, salad was plain, soup was lacking flavor. Fish from fish and chips was top notch. We had to get up twice to ask for ice at the bar. Just because we aren't ordering rounds of drinks, Carlos, doesn't mean we don't deserve attention. Annoyed to have spent hard earned money here.",Negative
"Plenty of sourdough rolls. Near the end of the day, two appetizers weren't available.

We were a large party. Food came out quickly. Clam chowder was good but too many potatoes. Crab was OK.

Server was friendly and attentive.",Positive
"This is still one of the better clam chowders I've had in SF. Rather than sit at the Wipeout bar downstairs, I decided to sit in the main restaurant at their bar for lunch. I started with a Fog Harbor lager, and then enjoyed my lunch combo of clam chowder in a bread bowl with side of Caesar salad. Both were delicious and very filling. Service was friendly, and about what you'd expect at a bar. Views in the restaurant are fantastic.",Positive
"The service and ambiance of this restaurant are great. The warm atmosphere and the nice fireplace with all of the beautiful decor (they had Christmas decor when we went) really make this a beautiful restaurant.

Although the food was also good, the portion sizes are so small for how much you pay. We wanted a light dinner and opted to share an appetizer (fried calamari) and an entree grilled chicken and shrimp), but we paid a lot more than we wanted to.

We walked here from our hotel in Fisherman's Wharf, so we did not have to deal with parking at all, but since it's on Pier 39, plan accordingly. Ubering or parking at a paid parking lot are the best options, unless you're walking distance from the restaurant.",Positive
"We've eaten here a few times before and it was never terrible, but this visit completely changed our minds. We came near the end of the day with a reservation for 8, and things went downhill right away. The hostess kept asking how many people were in our party, even though we told her 8 several times. It honestly felt like having a larger group was a problem for them. We ordered the baked oysters and they were disgusting. They were absolutely spoiled, and I had to spit mine out because I truly felt like I might get sick. The steak wasn't any better. It was mushy and had no flavor at all. The restaurant was packed, and you could tell they couldn't keep up with the quality of their food or service. The men's restroom was also dirty, which just added to the bad experience.
We've had this place multiple times , but it only takes one really bad experience to make you never want to come back. We definitely won't.",Negative
"TERRIBLE SERVICE! We were seated all the way in the back for about 20 minutes and no one came to help us out. We flagged them down multiple times and they looked and ignored us. I understand that they're busy, but at least have a server come and ask if we need any drinks, but nope completely ignored us so we walked right out",Negative
"The service was excellent & Million was very attentive. Unfortunately, the seafood risotto special was pretty terrible. It was pretty flavorless & the rice was not cooked properly. Risotto should be al dente but not crunchy. It's like the chef precooked it but forgot to finish it off. Probably the worse risotto I've ever had.",Negative
The food was amazing and came in big portions. The food also arrived fast for how busy it was. The service is fast and the wait staff are very nice. The restaurant is very cozy and is nicely decorated for the holiday season. Our table was also next to the window and the view was really pretty!,Positive
"I had dinner at Bottega in the Mission recently, and I honestly loved the vibe there. The place feels cozy but stylish , the lighting, music, and people all make it feel like the kind of spot you'd go with friends or even for a cute date night.

I ordered pasta (I tried the amatriciana) and it was so good! You can taste that it's homemade , the sauce was rich and flavorful, not too heavy, just right. They also served focaccia bread at the start, and it was super fresh and garlicky , I could've eaten a whole basket of that alone ,

The staff were friendly and made me feel really comfortable. Service was smooth even though it was busy , I went on a weekend evening, so it was a little loud, but that's kind of part of the fun vibe.",Positive
"Excellent service and the food was delicious. I would go back just to try the fettuccine again, which in my opinion is the best I've ever tasted.",Positive
"i went for a date. The food is delicious and her services excellent, i need come back",Positive
"I had a chance to do date night with the hubs and we decided to come to Bottega which is a nice trendy Italian spot. Thankfully we were seated and service was absolutely top notch. The bread here is delicious and flavorful which I absolutely loved. We ended up ordering:

* MEZZEMANICHE BOSCAIOLA - this pasta was delicious and the sauce was very flavorful. I would definitely get this again!

* PEPPERONI - this pizza was absolutely Delicious and came with hot honey which we asked for and this was delicious. The crust was yummy and flavorful and the pepperoni was very flavorful.

* Tiramisu - this was also yummy and creamy and every bite was scrumptious.

Definitely would go back here!",Positive
"We popped in at 5pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately. There were plenty of open tables until around 7pm when the restaurant started filling up.

For apps, we ordered the arancini ($14 for 3), brussel sprouts ($12), and parma ($13 for 4 slices). Everything was great and came out relatively quickly. The arancini came with a pea dipping sauce which was tasty.

For mains, we ordered the vodka pink pasta with chicken ($28), mezzemaniche with tomato sauce ($24), salsiccia pizza ($22), and guanciale ($23). By and large, we thought the pastas were better than the pizzas. Both our pastas were rigatoni dishes, and the rigatoni was cooked perfectly - not too al dente but not soggy with a good bite. The rigatoni Bottega uses is on the thicker side, so each piece was relatively substantial. The pizzas were fine but could use more sauce and felt a bit like eating bland bread.

Service was great from start to finish - welcoming, attentive, friendly. One small nit is towards the end of our meal, some folks came by to clear our table in its entirety as we were still sitting there, so we felt a bit rushed as we were boxing our leftovers and wrapping up conversations.",Positive
"I hadn't heard of Bottega before, but I'm very glad I know about it now! Warm and welcoming atmosphere and staff, delicious food, and quick service! Our waiter even gave us a tiramisu on the house for my friends birthday :) Will definitely be back",Positive
This place was good! The ambiance was 10/10 cozy with cool decorations. The staff were outrageously kind and friendly and helpful with the menu. We had a baby with us and were accommodating too (though I didn't ask for a high chair so idk if they have those). The food was good but not great. Brussel sprouts were probably the best? Glad I came of course but I'm not itching to come back.,Positive
"Came on a Sunday afternoon and a decent amount of people were eating. The inside was SO pretty and aesthetically pleasing.

Service was absolutely lovely. The food was SUPER good! I was obsessed with the bread and they gave us more when we finished our first round.

I love that their menu has preset pastas, but you can also build your own. I added burrata to mine and that was the move. Pasta was SOOO good and the serving was huge, I had to take it home!",Positive
"Unfortunately, I would not recommend the food here, and if you get takeout, be aware that you will have to wait a good amount of time even if you order ahead.

A couple months ago, I got the lasagna for takeout and had to wait a long time even when ordering in advance. It would be fine if the food were okay, but the sauce was just overly bitter. Surprising because it appears to be a favorite here.

I recently visited Bottega again with my sister because we were in the area, and she was craving a tiramisu. It's hard to mess up a tiramisu, so we figured we'll give it a shot.

When we pull up, her order isn't ready. Turns out, the kitchen never even received her order despite us ordering online ahead of time. I saw another reviewer mention their online orders not being received, so it appears to be an issue with their system. Once we showed the receipt for the tiramisu, I expected a dessert to be a lot faster to pack, but even that still took long.

When we finally tried it, we were extremely disappointed. It had very minimal coffee flavor and way too much cream in comparison to the ladyfingers. It honestly just reminded me of a dessert at a buffet. The tiramisu was packed sloppily in a takeout cup and barely filled halfway--We were shocked seeing this quality and portion for $10. Surprising again because the tiramisu appears to be loved here. Ended up going to Whole Foods in desperation for a tiramisu instead which was half the price, twice as good, and nearly twice as big.",Negative
"Came to this Italian restaurant super excited to try it as the ratings were really positive. But my experience and food was just not up to par. The server was not very helpfull as some of our friends have dietary constraints and the server had no idea what ingredients was in what dish when asked about it. The food also was not that good, felt a little bland and in some cases the combo just felt overwhelming such as with the truffle pizza.",Negative
"I've been a loyal customer of Bottega for over two years. Since it's in my neighborhood, I usually do takeout, and I've always loved their pasta, especially the bolognese!!!
Unfortunately, after today's experience, I'm not sure if I'll be coming back.

The old hostess used to be so nice and accommodating, but lately, the customer service has really gone downhill. I placed my order and arrived right on time, only to be told the kitchen never received it, even though I had a receipt showing my $50 order! I ended up waiting 20 minutes past my pickup time, and then, to make things worse, a waiter told me I needed to leave because the kitchen was closed. I explained it was a pickup order, but it didn't matter.

On top of that, I was given the wrong order.
Girl,why were there peas in my bolognese?
I don't even want to comment on what's happening with this Fettuccine Alfredo. At this point, I'd rather go to Olive Garden than Bottega.",Negative
"Their service is very racist to african Americans people considering how they have made me and my date wait 40 minutes from a 30 minute drive, forgot our noodles , and gave us bread and shrimp only , and took a 5$ tip for themselves without asking I was $5 short of my change of $100 of a $40 meal I didn't even get to enjoy with my date, bad look on Bottega San Fransico ,California",Negative
Serving atleast reason on the price. Calamari is so little with full of vegetables. Service are good but not recommended. I was disappointed,Negative
"i've been to bottega in san francisco a few times now, and every single time i've left feeling sick and nauseous. i always order the fettucine alfredo, and at first i thought maybe it was just me, but tonight confirmed it wasn't. my friends and i went together and all of us ended up feeling sick later in the night. i'm not sure if something is off with the food or what the issue might be, but it's definitely concerning. just wanted to share my experience so others can be aware.",Negative
"Before my last visit, I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Bottega. But last week's experience wiped that good taste away. The three appetizers ordered were just okay. The waitperson did not offer additional cheese or pepper. The focaccia was tasteless, and the weak olive oil added nothing. The waitperson came back to the table six minutes later with the entrees. A party of three cannot eat three appetizers in six minutes? My entrée, fettuccine with black truffle creme and chicken, was so bland that I couldn't eat it. One of my guests has a gnocchi pesto dish that was unwhelming. She ate three bites and left it. Her husband opted for lasagna. He ate his but said it was dull. The bread was never replenished, no red pepper flakes were offered, and the waitperson did not return until I asked for the check. Yes, I could have requested more bread and the flakes, but for the prices charged, I feel the waiter should have been more attentive. I will not return to Bottega.",Negative
"The server who set my pregnant girlfriend and I outside in the left corner, only checked on us once to take our waters and not bring us any more water and then on top of that never brought forks until our food was about to get cold. I also wanna say how rude this person is that with her fake accent
This is where I fully realized this lady was only judging my girlfriend and I because we were black and younger (we are 29 btw)
So my bill was $81
I give her 100 Bill and I asked her. Can you bring me a bag and the change?
At first, she never comes back until I see her and say hey can you bring me the change?
Not only does she bring the change she doesn't bring the bag slams the money on the table and says you people get out of here

The reason why I asked for the change was because instead of just tipping her $18 I wanted to give her a 20 and a five dollar bill. But after you people need to get out of here and you never bring my bag for my to go food my girlfriend has to walk inside and grab it. I really think somebody needs to speak to her because being prejudice and judgmental is just wrong when though I had an abundance of cash to give this server, but for what she didn't do anything, she never checked on us. She didn't bring us water. She didn't bring us food so I was only tipping because it's the right thing to do she did not allow me to do that",Negative
"I believe that the food here and service is great and the environment offered here allows for place to have a brunch or dinner. Although, after going to my last visit I must say that there was poor handling of my food. As I was eating my meal, I chewed and bit down into something hard. To my amazement, it was a staple that had fallen into my food. I'm not sure how it couldn't gotten there, but safe to say that it's not a pleasant thought to think, ""what if I had swallowed that?"" ""What kind of damage could that have caused?"". Thankfully, I caught before I could swallow.
I think that the restaurant is great in all aspects in allowing the guest feel they are being taken care of and enjoying their time. Yet, there need to be more measures in preventing accidents like this that can cause some serious injury.",Negative
"My boyfriend and I dined here on
3/16/25 at 7 PM in the left corner of the restaurant and our server was a male with an accent. The entire experience was awful. The pepperoni pizza was bland, and the fried mozzarella also had no flavor. We each had one slice and one piece before deciding we didn't want any more. Since we paid for it, we packed it up rather than waste it.

A dog from the table beside us kept walking under our table, which was uncomfortable, and our server was indifferent. Before we got up to leave after exactly 30 minutes, he stares us down at our table AFTER PAYING and follows us through the restaurant, repeatedly asking, ""The service wasn't good?"" in front of other diners. My boyfriend politely explained that the food was disappointing, but instead of handling it professionally, he got defensive and argued, ""But you took the food to go."" I am entitled as a paying customer to do whatever I want with my leftovers.

He wouldn't let it go and eventually waved his hand in my face before walking off. No customer should be harassed for not tipping, especially after bad food and mediocre service. Completely unprofessional, I will I never be back, and I hope the server is reprimanded for his entitled conduct.


Response to Owner:
I'm not surprised by your response, given how you handle criticism from other guests on yelp. Defending your server's unprofessional behavior instead of holding him accountable says everything about your establishment. Last I checked, I was the one followed and confronted over a tip. If you're so confident in your version of events, check your security cameras--the footage will speak for itself.

And don't try to gaslight me by claiming I was both ""reassuring"" the server and also ""yelling"" at him. Which one is it? The reality is, I calmly explained the food was disappointing, and he became defensive and confrontational. Your attempt to twist the situation is just as unprofessional as his behavior.

Twisting this into me being rude or is so laughable. I don't owe you or your staff a tip for bad food and mediocre service. Maybe focus on improving instead of chasing customers down when they don't tip. No one should be guilt-tripped or humiliated over it--period.

And let's be clear: a dog shouldn't be wandering under my table in the first place. That's a management issue, not mine. As for my leftovers, I took home food I paid for and gave it to a homeless person--so no, I didn't ""lose out"" by never coming back. If this is how you treat paying customers, then you've only proven my point.",Negative
"Really wanted to like this place, it was cute. Sensitive manager/owner was terribly rude.

Ordered a beer, a cocktail, calamari, lamb ragu, and a build your own pasta. Beer was served almost immediately, 15 minutes later we got the two entrees. Reminded them of the missing cocktail, saw the waitress go back and forth with the bartender before the cocktail finally arrived and she politely apologized. All was forgotten as the drink was so good - it was the Hella Good cocktail.

I forgot about the calamari and asked that it be cancelled, given our entrees had already arrived. They seemed to be very confused about the calamari and came over twice to ask who I ordered with - entire order was put in with the waitress.

Sent the food back for severely undercooked pasta. Tall guy came over and proceeded to lecture us about how he was offended that we sent the food back. Actually yelling and lecturing us. Not my fault the pasta was so undercooked it was pasty.

Worst dining experience ever. I wouldn't be surprised to see a nasty reply to this review from the lecture guy - who never introduced himself, just came over and began his rant about being offended.

If I was wrong about the pasta, there were a ton of different ways to handle it as a manager/business owner. Thanks for ruining our evening.",Negative
"If you were to visit, place yourself on Yelp Waitlist before leaving. It will save you time waiting outside the restaurant. My boyfriend and I were seated 10 minutes after our check-in time. They situated us down with the menu, water and bread. We placed our order shortly after, but this was the end of our peace...

One server came out with ""our"" food, but it was not. We politely told him it was not ours because he said it was a gluten-free pasta, which neither of us ordered. However, he tried to tell us that this is what we ordered and we were wrong. After a quick conversation, he took the pasta away. Another server came by after to give us our food, which was close to right (right pasta wrong sauce). However, we didnt want to deal with the previous conversation again, so we went along with the dishes as it was almost right. When we received our check, we noticed that we were charged for pesto sauce (PLEASE LOOK AT THE PICTURES AND LET ME KNOW WHICH ONE IS PESTO SAUCE BECAUSE EVIDENTLY I DONT KNOW MY COLORS). We tried to tell the server of the mistake, which he just dismissed it by saying it will be the same price regardless (which is incorrect as we verified online that the fee only applies if it is a pesto sauce)

The food also doesn't justify the poor service:
- Bread (3/5) - decent, but cold and soggy
- Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with pink sauce (4/5) - too many peas and flavor was a bit salty to my liking
- Gnocchi with pink sauce (2/5) - honestly Trader Joes does it better

If it wasn't for the service, this place could be better...",Negative
"Where do I even begin. Let's start with the cold, stale rubber that they try to pass for bread. Truffle sauce had 0 flavor. Eggplant appetizer...what eggplant? More like fried paper mache. if you're into trader joe's cacio e pepe et al. frozen pastas then this place is for you.

the ambience was like stepping into a 13 year old girl's bedroom. with rickety chairs covered with pink cushions and tacky lamps. don't understand all the good reviews. Beware.",Negative
Dinner was going great until we seen an unexpected friend. Very disappointed and gross (roach).,Negative
"Just got married, came here and it had a very unwelcoming vibe. The lady with big eyes there was extremely rude and didn't wanna serve us at the bar. It took her a while to get there and when she did, she was just rude. She told us she didn't have pineapple juice even though we just ordered it was another staff member. The waiter asked us if it was our prom or wedding... so disrespectful.. the bride was wearing a veil. One of the staff members kept watching my wife and making her very uncomfortable and was staring at her chest.

If you're of a person of color or a LGBTQ+ couple, don't expect to feel welcomed. It is a beautiful place and the food is great! We used to come here a lot but wow this time was really disappointing. Especially on our big day",Negative
"If you are considering them for any important event, DO NOT RESERVE HERE. We booked their private room in advance for our wedding dinner reception and they called us less than a month before the wedding and told us that they have to cancel our reservation because ""they have a problem"". Their words exactly. They couldn't give an explanation. They said they'd have the manager call me. Which never happened. And they asked if I wanted to reschedule for the day before or after which is absolutely ludicrous to be expected to move the ceremony, reception, and all people booked for that date to a different date. We scrambled to try and find a decent place to have our wedding reception this short notice. We called the day of the wedding and came to find out they cancelled our reservation because someone else was willing to pay more money even though THEY were the ones who set the price that we already agreed to. I would not count on this place for anything important because they will cancel on you as long as someone else with a bigger wallet comes along. Your reservation means nothing to this place.

Update: Reply in response to owner's comment.
My review is entirely appropriate as that was my experience. The mistake has nothing to do with me. The fault was entirely due to your lack of communication with your employees. If you were in fact already working with another company before we made the reservation that date it should have been blocked out to prevent this situation. And the fact that you even have the audacity to claim that because someone is having an intimate wedding dinner that it is easy to find is rather insulting. You have no idea what trouble someone goes through to ensure the aesthetics suit the location chosen. Also, the lie that no one knew it was for a wedding when we were specifically asked if we had a wedding cake that we needed to store for the date. Your response has already proven your lack of customer service because in no way shape or form did you try to rectify the situation even when you or your restaurant manager was suppose to call us regarding this reservation. It is a complete lack of professionalism for an owner to pass the blame to their employees. Own up to your mistake if it is your establishment as one should do when running a business.",Negative
"Ordered to go on Yelp so unsure of ambiance. Delivered fast.

I did the build your own pasta.

I did the rigatoni with garlic, chicken, and pink pasta. The pasta was Al dente for sure. Barely taste the garlic: chicken was dry. Pink pasta sauce taste store bought like or like frozen food.

The second one was the Ravioli, garlic, mushroom, onion, Italian sausage, and bolognese sauce. Ravioli is good. Didn't see any onions and i paid extra, barely 4 slices piece of mushroom and paid $2 extra, no garlic flavor, but there was a lot of Italian sausage pieces. Sausage is bland. The sauce basically taste like spaghetti O ravioli sauce the one you can buy at Walmart.

Most likely would never order from here again. Doesn't taste fresh, authentic, or has much flavor. Didn't come with utensils, so make sure to ask for it.",Negative
Some for the worst spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had. The tomato sauce tasted like thick tomato soup or like they simply dumped a can of crushed tomatoes on it without flavoring it. No oregano or garlic or even onion. Truly terrible.,Negative
"Yelp failed me. After watching Hamilton I turned to yelp for Pasta recs. Street parking and at 11pm I found on a block away. We got seated right away but it took them a while to actually come get our order. A group seated after us had their order and food come out first. On a whim, a server came and asked if we had placed our order (which we didn't) so he took it. It was very loud and very hard to hear from across the table. I was still eating the appetizer when the entree came and as I stuck my fork they took the plate away even though my fork was grabbing food. Well ok.. they dropped off the entree and no one ever came back. No water refilled, no bread, no one to ask if everything was ok. 2 of our pasta dishes were severely undercooked. My chicken parm was in a pool of sauce so not crispy at all. We kept waving the server to get our check and even that took a long time. Super disappointed and really regret throwing my money in the trash for this place",Negative
"Tried this place a couple months ago with a party of 2 and the food was great. Recently came to try this place again with a party of 3 on 11/30/24 and had the worst experience with getting a table. I came to sign up for the waiting list to sit inside and the hostess told us it would be about 20 minutes, so we waited. The hostess then said we would be seated next because a table was clearing up, so we waited and then when the table was clear they gave it to another group, but the hostess said we can wait at the bar since another table was almost done also. So we waited at the bar for maybe 30ish mins and noticed parties who arrived after us getting seated. So eventually we just left. It seemed like they were expecting us to just settle with the bar and never get a table.",Negative
Ordered delivery so disappointed the minestrone was super oily and the fried artichokes were very salty a complete disappointment,Negative
"Really wanted to like this place based on all the rave reviews and photos! Sort reviews by date and you'll see reviews are quite polarizing and I can see why. Employees were aloof. 5 servers passed us before anyone tried to seat us, even though everyone was standing around before half the tables were even filled. It was early before the dinner rush. They finally seated us at the corner of the restaurant against the window bench. A servers kept bumping into our chairs, no apologies. Menus felt greasy and sticky. Floors were filthy. Everything about this place just felt sloppy.",Negative
"I legitimately do not understand how this place has so many positive reviews. I get it. The place is cute and aesthetically pleasing with a cute neon sign above the bar.

I'm pretty sure this place is only so popular because of tik tok and instagram, because the food is nothing special if not utterly bland.

The metal seats are atrociously uncomfortable. The little table lights can't stay on.

There are so many good Italian places in San Francisco that this place is just not worth coming to.",Negative
"One of the worst experiences I've ever had. If you're trying to book a reservation for a big group ,good luck because this has been nothing short of a nightmare.

I called in about a month and a half ago trying to book a reservation for 10 people . I spoke to someone on the phone about booking the upstairs room for a set date. I thought everything was situated.

When I called , they had told me someone else had already booked the upstairs room & I was disappointed with their lack of communication . That was strike one .

They rectified the situation and told me that they can go ahead and accommodate my party of 10 downstairs. I thought that was all confirmed but when I checked in a few weeks ago .. the person that was answering the phone seemed oblivious of that reservation . I was passed onto the manager that said he would go ahead and input our party down. The lady even took down my name and number , date & time of event. I thought that was all set . WRONG .

I think I literally called the place 5 times to confirm my reservation and every single time everyone acts clueless . The last straw was when I called & same crap again with no reservation for my party. Total waste of time & energy . It shouldn't take this much time and effort to book a dinner.

The people running this place needs to have better communication & honesty. I don't appreciate them wasting my time especially when I told them I can book at another place if they couldn't accommodate. It's literally a week away & hate that this place couldn't just tell me a month and half ago they wouldn't be about to accommodate my request. Also, I don't appreciate the misinformation about booking the upstairs room. Someone had quotes $50 per person minimum . Someone else quotes 1k minimum for booking upstairs . Idk why their pricing isn't consistent.

So glad I don't need this added stress & was able to book somewhere else with ease ! Don't waste your time if you're looking to book for a big group.",Negative
My pasta :( it fell off me plate and they didnt get me new one. please make pastas less sliper,Negative
"Highway robbery. We ordered the special of the day - Sanddab fish. The dish came out COLD - the fish we covered completely with murky sauce and capers. I don't even know if it is sandab or tilapia or ??? and, it costs $38.00 (now, you know why I said earlier it is highway robbery). The kitchen just simply put our dish in the oven to re-heat. Does it taste good? NO. Not good at all. Oh, we ordered an IPA -- never arrived.

I felt so insulted. DON'T COME HERE. I WILL NEVER GO BACK.",Negative
"Celebrated here at this restaurant with 30+ people. They were so accommodating & all the servers were very friendly. They were able to serve a large party AND still be able to catch up and serve the rest of the customers in the restaurant.

Parking can be hard, but there's some public garage parking near the restaurant. The ambiance inside is so beautiful since I'm a sucker for dim lighted restaurants. Their food are delicious, the only thing I didn't like from the menu was the pesto pasta. It was too bland and did not taste like pesto for me at all. My favs from their menu was the branzino, truffle pasta, and the truffle pizza. It was super flavorful & cooked so well. They have a really good appetizer selection. Overall, very impressed with the restaurant & the team.",Positive
"I enjoy Italian food and great pasta, but I feel like this just wasn't the restaurant for me.

Came here with a group of friends to enjoy dinner and ahead of the visit I scanned the menu and was a little disappointed to see that the menu was what I like to call ""one note"".

Italy is a beautiful country with a diverse cuisine, but this menu really just hits on the overly heavy dishes typically enjoyed by Americans. I was surprised to see it was nearly absent of center plate, proteins, grilled items and even vegetables, aside from a few salads.

We started with a number of appetizers, almost all of which were fried, including the artichoke hearts, calamari, and arancini. All of them were nicely fried, not greasy and crispy on the outside, but in general, I felt this was pretty expected.

We then ordered pizzas and pasta dishes, and I'll say that the pasta was quite good. I chose the sacchetti with Gorgonzola to was very delicious, with the perfect al dente texture too. All of my dining companions agreed as well. There were other solid pasta choices too, so if this is what you're after, I'd definitely visit. We all also really loved the gluten free pasta with house sausage too, and it was nice that they had this as an option.

The other standout entree was the chicken parmigiana, which had great texture and a delightful tangy tomato sauce that made you want to lick the plate clean.

Pizzas were all tasty too, but after fried apps and pasta, it was tough to really enjoy them.

All in all the food was tasty and great for a group, with wonderful service. Cocktails were def very mid imho, and I did expect better from a restaurant in SF.",Positive
"We got the fettuccine alfredo, salmon fettuccine, pesto gnocchi, calzone, and started with an appetizer of brussel sprouts. They also give you complimentary bread to pair with balsamic and olive oil. Solid taste and had nothing to complain about, the food is as expected of Italian food.

Notable customer service, staff refers to all the female customers by bella; it's super cute. They were also very attentive and helpful with choosing menu items. The prices were also comparable to most pasta places too.",Positive
"The food was honestly great. I got the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with vodka sauce. It was done very well. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the sausage was very delicious with the right texture and flavor. My one complaint is that the vodka sauce could have been on the creamier side because the tomato flavor was definitely overpowering, and I would have appreciated a little less acidity and sweetness from the tomato. I would say the vodka pasta at Carbone was definitely better. On the other hand, my friend got the Mezzelune ai Porcini and WOW. That shit was amazing like after my first bite I literally had to sit back and take a moment because it was that good. The truffle was done perfectly, which a flavor that most places do so wrong. The sauce was amazing the ravioli was perfect. Literally one of the best pastas I had. The complimentary bread was also so so good. The mushrooms on it, the crispiness of the crust, the soft fluffiness of the bread, everything was amazing. The quality of the olive oil they gave us was amazing as well. Also ask for their spicy sauce, it was unexpectedly so good for an Italian restaurant. My only complaint with the food was the tiramisu it was a big let down. I would never get it again. There was simply not enough cream. This is pretty bad to say but I would say it's was a Costco level tiramisu. Other than that, the service was great, our waiter was very attentive, and brought out everything quickly as well. The ambience was also very nice: the calm lighting, the restaurant volume, and the cleanliness was all on par of a nice classy restaurant.",Positive
"This place always had a crazy line outside, so I got curious one day what the food hype was and got takeout while I was in the Mission. I got the salmon fettucine and unsurprisingly the wait for the order was long too. I enjoyed the dish -- very creamy and filling, and they didn't skimp on the portion size. I think would have been better to pair this with some veggies or something less heavy, but overall would go back to try more dishes in person!",Positive
"Bottega to me is a hidden tucked away gem. The atmosphere seems very lively and fun for any type of celebration.

I came here recently with my husband for our 1 year anniversary. The staff greeted us right away at the door, we did not have to wait for too long at all. The server was just as equally friendly and helpful when we didn't know what to pick to eat.

Food tasted fresh and delicious. The portions weren't too small yet not too big. I loved the lemon lemoncello cake that we had at the end of the night. The cake was delicious and made a lasting impression.",Positive
"This place was super busy and was filled with big group events (at one point the whole restaurant joined in on singing a diner happy birthday). Even so, we were immediately seated at the bar. The focaccia bread was very soft and light, and we weren't served any more after the first plate, which I was okay with since I prefer my focaccia to have more variety in texture.

We ordered the polpette, mezzemaniche, and mezzelune. The meatballs were soft and yummy in a perfectly tart san marzano sauce, and I was left wanting more. The mezzemaniche was a bit too sweet for me, and didn't feel super flavorful (we got the vodka sauce). The rigatoni was a perfect al dente texture though, and the peas were a nice touch. As for the mezzelune, the truffle flavor really came through and was a favorite for me.

I was surprisingly very full at the end of the meal and had to take the rest home to-go. The service was a bit harried -- it took the bartender asking two other waiters and a while to get us our forks after our pasta came -- but it was a very busy night. They also asked if we wanted to share, and served us our mezzemaniche pre-split into two plates.",Positive
"Bruschetta was good, presentation was pretty; but hard to share since the mozzarella was in one piece.
Calamari was very salty, but tasty.

We ordered 2 Espresso martinis; one came in a martini glass and the other came in a coup. The coup was prettier!

Servers were super nice and attentive.

It is first come first serve, so they don't take reservations. They have inside seating and outside.

Everything was good, but not 5 star material.",Positive
"Really loved their pasta dishes here. The salmon fettuccini was so good; not really sure how they managed to get the texture and flavor of the salmon just right but it hit.

Calamari and bruschetta are solid appetizer options.

Everything was really fresh and cooked well. The wait staff are super friendly and food comes out quick.

Not too quiet but not too lively where you can't hold a conversation either. Definitely on the short list for good Italian food the next time you're in the area.

",Positive
"Bussin. This place was poppin (makes sense for a Friday night). We didn't have to wait too long for a table which was nice. The interior is super cute, high ceilings, vibey. It is definitely louder and attracts a younger crowd.

We ordered the calamari, the burrata, and shared the pasta special of the night. We got the bread first, which is really good. The outside is crunchy, inside soft and pillowy.

TBH all the food was so good. Calamari was fried perfectly, flavored well. I loved the veggies they include as well. Pasta was perfectly al dente, sauce was fire.

The service was amazing also. I really appreciated how the server split our pasta into 2 different plates for us to share. She was also so sweet and I felt extremely well taken care of.

Overall, really great experience, would love to come back again and try their other dishes!",Positive
"Great upscale, cozy Italian restaurant with terrific food AND service! We went for an early (6:15pm) dinner last night and have walked by this restaurant before and noticed the food being brought out, food & drinks at tables and saw how clean their outside dining room/parklet was. We have read Yelp reviews (mostly positive!) and finally had an opportunity to try this place. Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by the Server, Busser and Host as she just seated another party and rushed to greet us :)
We sat towards the back where the bar was located and a few people were there enjoying their cocktails and food (pizza).
The atmosphere inside had a contemporary look and feel with extremely high ceilings, well decorated (but not too much) and I liked that each table had a bright LED table lamp that added just the right amount of ambiance and lighting for us to see our menu, drinks and food.
Sara, our server greeted us and was very professional, courteous and helpful. She told us about the daily specials including soup du jour, drinks and entrees. We had a few questions about dinner drinks and ended up trying a couple of non-alcoholic drinks: ""Sweet Dreams"" and ""Pink Paloma"" (both $10 each). The Sweet Dreams drink included watermelon juice, orange juice and lemonade and the Pink Paloma included grapefruit soda, lemon juice & mango . Both were delicious! We saw the Bartender making the drinks and they seemed to be enjoying making them as I noticed them engaging with the customers seated at the bar section. Both drinks were slightly on the sweet side but was refreshing!
There was a Bing Crosby black and white movie (1945 - The Bells of St. Mary's) being shown on one of their large walls. The sound was turned off but was a nice addition to the restaurant atmosphere.

For starters, we shared the ""Insalata Di Spinaci and Barbabietole"" ($14) that consisted of spinach, almonds, dried fruit, beets and goat cheese.
The salad was served chilled and I could faintly smell balsamic vinegar from the dressing. The portion was very large considering we both shared the salad and tasted like the spinach was just picked from the garden. There was a generous portion of beets, slivered almonds too.
We each ordered the ""Spaghetti Con Le Polpette"" ($21) that included freshly made pasta, san marzano tomato sauce, sauteed with 3 large meatballs. We could not finish this and Sara brought over two to-go boxes for us to bring home.


We look forward to coming back soon as I saw ""Branzino""/fillet of wild mediterranean sea-bass ($31) listed in the Entree section and plan to try this during our next visit.
Great job Sara and the Bottega crew!
",Positive
"I visited Bottega in the Mission District to celebrate a friend's graduation on Saturday night. We made a reservation and got seated shortly after. The ambiance was impressive and the vibes were great. This spot is decorated nicely with florals and neon signs.

The portions are not too small and I thoroughly enjoyed my pasta. We also ordered cocktails but they were on the sweeter side. Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in SF!",Positive
"The food is delicious, I reaaly enjoyed my experience I went for my birthday and definitely I need come back! I loved the vibe there. The place feels cozy but stylish , the lighting, music. and the way they treat their customer is so polite and warming. good service!",Positive
"Recently visited this place (again), and *chefs kiss*. I ordered their build your own pasta and got their truffle be pink sauce. It was divine! Also ordered their fried mozzarella. I could've lived without that one.
Loved how they open late so if you're in the area, quick stop to get your pasta fix. Parking can be difficult even late at night, but it's ok. It's worth it!",Positive
"Yummy yum yum
Everything was great the service,food everything was great
They had outdoor seating which was nice as well",Positive
"The first thing I'm going to say about this place is that I was so hungry I only got a picture of one of the many apps we ordered. Trust me when I say, everything on the menu is good. I went with some coworkers on a work trip and we were lucky enough to be seated in our own private upstairs balcony. Everything tasted amazing and so authentic. I ordered the gluten free penne with truffle cream sauce and Italian sausage and oh my goodness I've never had pasta that tasted that amazing!",Positive
"We had heard good things about Bottega, so we were super excited to try it. Normally that means my expectations are too high, but this time reality exceeded expectations!

We started with the crab cakes - delicious, good taste of crab, and a nice kick.

For our entrees, we got the chicken parmesan and fettuccine alfredo.

The chicken parm had a really good sauce and tasty cutlet, with an interesting choice rigatoni as the pasta. And the fettuccine alfredo had very nice pasta with delicious cream.

A great restaurant and would love to come again!",Positive
"I loved the cozy atmosphere here. Every dish was carefully prepared, and the service was excellent. I can't wait to come back.",Positive
"Sisterita in San Francisco is an absolute standout! The moment I walked in, I felt that perfect SF blend of warm neighborhood charm and stylish modern vibes. The staff was incredibly welcoming and attentive without feeling overbearing--they genuinely made the experience feel special.

The food was the real star. Every dish was full of flavor, beautifully crafted, and clearly made with high-quality ingredients. You can tell the kitchen puts care into every plate. The portions were generous, and the menu had that unique twist that makes Sisterita feel truly memorable among SF dining spots.

The atmosphere is cozy but lively, making it perfect for a date, a dinner with friends, or even a solo treat-yourself meal.

If you're in San Francisco and want a place that delivers excellent food, great service, and a warm vibe, Sisterita should be at the top of your list. I'm already planning my next visit!",Positive
"I really enjoyed their crab fried rice, I dont see this being one of their popular dishes however I truly enjoyed it and could not stop thinking about it ever since. Thier matcha is just okay but I didn't have high hopes for that and plus matcha wasn't the main reason why I went.

The service is good, the place is tiny so it managable thouhg I can see how crazy and packed it can get.

This is near chinatown and I highly recommend walking around and up that hill to digest (;",Positive
"Parisian library/cafe vibes but with an American/Thai twist.

I ordered the Alcatraz Escape which was a Thai tom yum omelette with four large shrimp and a side salad. I liked I could taste the tom yum but it wasn't overpowering. Also really enjoyed the Rich Dad Poured Dad manhattan for breakfast. I mean, it's 5pm somewhere - never too early. The passion fruit cocktail was also good.

My party also ordered the egg benny, chicken and waffles, grilled cheese and French onion soup.

Service attentive. Would be back to try the brioche French toast.",Positive
"this place is great! I came on a Saturday morning around 10 without a reservation. I knew this place was popular so I was scared I wouldn't get in, but it seemed like the brunch rush did not pick up until around 11. The ambience of the restaurant is fantastic with such delightful decor. I could sit and just hang out all day. I was here with a group of four and we tried a lot of of the hits of the menu. The crab curry rice dish was a fan favorite. A very unique venue item with a huge portion and tons of flavor. I like the Tom Yum omelette as well. What will keep me coming back are those potatoes! Trust me and get an extra order for the table. We also got the French toast for the table as a dessert. Yes it was very tasty and I enjoyed it quite a bit, but did it totally blow my mind? Maybe not. Had a great time here though and service is great as well.",Positive
"I absolutely enjoyed the food at this brunch spot!! I recommend getting a reservation because the place is on the smaller side.

I got French toast which turned out really well! The nuts added a nice crunch and the dish was played very well.

My friends got fried chicken and waffles and I must say that I really liked the taste of the fried chicken. May have to try that dish when I visit next time.

Ambiance was nice as well! Very nice and cutely decorated cafe vibes",Positive
"My husband and I came here after reading the raving reviews! and now adding my own :) the inside is pretty small but very beautiful aesthetic! The Neptune was delicious, creamy and so good! My husband got the chicken and waffles and he really enjoyed it. Service was great as our drinks were topped off continuously. Happy that I trusted the reviews!",Positive
"Came here for a work brunch with the team and it didn't disappoint! We had a reservation for 6 people around 11AM on a Thursday. It wasn't too busy yet as we arrived before the lunch rush.

Only half of our party was able to check in on time and they were nice enough to seat us while we waited for the rest of our group to arrive. The restaurant's interior is cozy, cute and aesthetic! I ordered the Country Style Omelet with a side salad and slice of bread. The rest of the menu looked SO good including the plethora of non-alcoholic drinks.

My dish was delicious (and the perfect amount!), and everyone seemed to like their orders as well considering most of us ended up finishing our food :)

Service was great - we were always getting our waters refilled and were constantly getting checked on to see if we needed anything else.

Would highly recommend getting a reservation if you plan on coming during the weekend or during a busier time of day as the interior is a bit small.

Overall, a solid brunch spot in the city!",Positive
"Wow, everything about this place is top notch. Loved the vibe of this cute little restaurant, presentation of the food, and the flavors. Definitely try to get a reservation because the place is tiny. I can see it being hard to get in. We went in on a weekday. On to the food .

Alcatraz escape: literally tasted so good with a blend of Thai flavors (5/5)

Voila French toast: I broke my calories for this and it did not disappoint. 5/5

It was just two of us and the perfect amount of food. Good service and we were out of there quickly.",Positive
"My ""SISTER"" and I came for an overdue brunch. We pushed the reservation back twice and were easily accommodated. We were greeted warmly and that's a BIG plus for me!!

The vibe was giving sheik, upscale Library and Restaurant !! Their massive bookshelf with real books was a great addition to the space.

Our food was flavorful and delicious. We ordered two rice dishes with crab. The sauce on the crab fried rice was simply amazing. It was hearty and filling...enough to share!!

Our cocktails were delicious! We ordered a pineapple and Hibiscus mimosa. It was just the right ratio of champagne to juice.

Next time, we'll order different items on the menu to share.",Positive
"Where do I even start?! My fiancé and I absolutely loved this place. From the moment we walked in, it felt like we had been transported back to Europe--specifically Italy--enjoying a cozy breakfast café. The décor was charming, the music set the perfect vibe, and the space had such an inviting energy.

It was clear this spot is well-loved, as the restaurant was completely full and we had a bit of a wait. But it was so worth it. I ordered the French toast, which was delicious, and my latte was just as enjoyable.

It's been a few weeks since our visit, and we're still talking about how great it was. We can't wait to go back!",Positive
"Amazing brunch with a unique take on fusion. The Voila French Toast which was soft, dense, and mildly sweet. The bananas were overly ripe which helped with the natural sweetness. The Alcatraz Escape was very unique. A Thai fusion omelet with tom yum paste and shrimps made for a flavorful combination that I have not had. Make sure to book reservations in advance. Went during opening hour on the weekend and once we finished eating there was a moderate line out of the restaurant.",Positive
"Their food was so good. The food was so good we actually went here 2 times on our short trip. It was our first meal and last meal in San Francisco 2025. I ordered the Pad Kra Pao and the wife ordered the King of the West Coast. She orderd their tiger tea latte both mornings. The second time eating here I ordered their espresso martini. The restaurant is a short uber ride from union square. The service was great both times we dined in.

We ended up just passing our plates back and forth across the table because we couldn't get enough of each's order. Will probably be back in December with our family for some more good food.",Positive
"The restaurant is very beautifully decorated. We were seated immediately with no reservation, which was incredibly convenient. The service was fast, and the food was absolutely delicious. No extra syrup was necessary for the French toast, it was so sweet and flavorful!",Positive
"Sisterita is flat out my top favorite restaurant in the Bay area. Outstanding flavors, gorgeous space, delicious menu, sweetest staff. We are foodies and our bar is set very high. Sisterita was so outstanding and flavorful, we raved about it all weekend. Whatever you are doing over there, continue forever please. You hold a special place in my heart!!

Grilled Prawn Tacos - bursting with flavor!!!
Crispy Chicken Fried Rice - outstanding
French Onion Soup - packed with depth & flavor
French Fries",Positive
"I've been eyeing this spot for a while and we decided to have brunch here on a weekday. Parking is limited, we had to park about two blocks away, lots of foot traffic in the area. This cute little restaurant is tucked into an alleyway. The aesthetics are on point. They are so friendly and inviting. No wait, we were seated right away. The stand out dish is the GRILLED PRAWN TACOS, yes it's that loud lol. That was my favorite bite out of everything. If I go back, it will be for those tacos. I'm still trying to make out the flavor profile, it is spicy, fragrant of Thai spices, fresh, and it tasted like fruit loops, I know I know, weird, right?! But it works, try it!!",Positive
"We had reservations but life/traffic got in the way and ended up having to order takeout before they closed instead... but wow PERFECT MEAL. They had good reviews, and we loved the decor inside, but truly the flavor profiles blew us away and we can't wait to come back to San Francisco and eat Sisterita again!!!

CRISPY CHICKEN FRIED RICE--- this is an absolute must. Mandatory for anyone who enjoys fried rice, the fried rice is different. It has like Malaysian/thai flavors, I am not 100% sure but as an Asian person I've had over 100 fried rices in my life and this one was insane.

GRILLED PRAWN TACOS-- wow those giant ass prawns were fantastically seasoned.

FRENCH ONION SOUP -- on the side plate part of the menu has an unassuming French onion soup option and it was delightful. Like probably so much better fresh in house but I had it to-go and it still was incredible.

All weekend after we ate it we kept talking about Sisterita. We're gonna sing the Sisterita gospel, may they live forever!!!!!",Positive
"This place can get really busy, so plan accordingly. It's tucked away in a small street in San Francisco, best way to get there could be Uber or plan to park your car and block or two away.
French inspired with with a hint of San Francisco local and a dash of Vietnamese.",Positive
"What a pleasant surprise, tucked away off Portsmouth Square near Chinatown. Food is basic well known dishes with their own spin. Awesome Espresso martini too!
Highly recommend!!",Positive

"We had an incredible breakfast at Sisterita on our last day in SF. We found them on Yelp and discovered that they were the top featured hot & new business in the Bay area a couple years ago. The restaurant was a just a short walk from our hotel and I'm so glad that our little group chose this place.

We arrived with a party of 5 around 9:30am on a Friday morning and were seated right away. I know this is a popular spot, so getting there early helped since they were definitely on a wait by the time we finished our meal. The interior itself is a cozy, small, and well-designed space that reminds me of a European cafe with crown molding and bookshelves lining the walls. The food has a lot of Thai & French influence balanced with New American fare.

We started with some hot beverages including cappuccinos, tea service, and their signature Tiger Latte which is a Thai tea mocha. The Tiger Latte was amazing and I would 100% order it again. We ordered our main dishes next, and I love that everyone selected something different.

I went with the classic two-egg breakfast with the spicy honey glazed bacon and breakfast potatoes. THAT BACON...OMG. I've come to realize that fancy thick-cut bacon (also known as millionaire's bacon) is a breakfast & brunch staple in SF and I'm not mad about it.

My husband wanted a protein packed breakfast and went with the New York Steak & Eggs which he really enjoyed. One of my colleagues ordered the Belgian waffle & fried chicken which she quote unquote said was the best chicken & waffles she's ever had. We, of course, also had to order the Voilà French Toast Brioche for the table to share. It's topped with grand marnier, citrus butter, caramelized bananas, blueberries, strawberries, and candied walnuts and comes with a fondue a' la vanille to drizzle on top. If you want something sweet, this dish is a MUST!

The service was quick & efficient and overall, it was one of the better breakfast experiences I've had. I'll definitely visit again the next time I'm in SF!",Positive
"The perfect brunch, wow! Shout out to fellow CM -Erik S for this stellar find. This place is an unassuming hidden gem and the perfect shade of green from the outside. Inside is beautiful, bright, and had the cutest pattern on the floor.

Service was very quick, helpful, and friendly. I got the don't chase get chosen drink. You can add booze if you'd like but I chose not to and it was refreshing and light. To eat I got the wagyu beef burger and loved it!! Very filling and a hint of spice with the pepper jack and burger sauce. The fries were so amazing and had just the right crunch.

I got to try a little bit of food from around the table and everything was fantastic. Definitely added to my SF bookmarks.",Positive
"I had a full free day in San Fran, and I wasn't the only one. Some of my colleagues also had late flights, and we decided to start the day off with brunch. I happened to catch wind that they were busier than normal, so someone called in for a reservation with relative short notice. And THANK goodness they did -- when we got there, it was so crowded! We got there way earlier than the reservation time we said, and we were told to wait a bit... and we were seated within 10 minutes.

The curtains, the library nook, the whole vibe -- the place has such a charm to it. The menu is very brunchy with both a French and Thai twist. I decided on the grilled prawn tacos, which I have zero regrets about. It was two HUGE and LOADED tacos, with wonderful ingredients. You normally get a choice of either fries or salad, but I was able to do sweet potato fries. What an absolute win!

I'd definitely be back, and I'll be sure to make a reservation. With a 2:00pm closing time, you really don't have a choice.",Positive
Delightful place! Staff were very friendly. Drinks and food tasty and quality. Can't wait to go back and try more menu items.,Positive
"This place is worth all the hype! Hands down.

Did not have a reservation but showed up at 12:30 with a line out the door. They were able to seat us at the bar and let me just say--the service by the bartender was phenomenal. Very attentive while juggling drink orders.

I ordered the grilled cheese and onion soup--BY FAR THE BEST ONION SOUP I HAVE EVER HAD. That sandwich was delicious and very complimentary with the soup. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast burrito which also was very delicious.

The cocktails were on point--had the Harry's Potter and The Secret.

The decor and ambiance were very chic and cute. Would definitely recommend trying!!! New favorite spot in SF",Positive
"Cute, aesthetic brunch spot! Came here as a group of 4 last weekend. We had a reservation for 1:30pm and the restaurant was pretty packed. We came a little early so we waited about 10 minutes before they seated us.

We ordered two sides of French Onion Soup and the Voila French Toast Brioche to share. These were delicious! The french toast is a must try. It was so good.

For my personal order, I got the Emerald Egg Benny with a side of sweet potato fries. This dish was heavy and hearty. The eggs were perfectly poached and the chicken was nice and juicy. The chicken and sauce did make the bread a little soggy and I could've done without the bell peppers. Nonetheless, this dish was enjoyable.

Overall, we had a wonderful meal here and we all left full and filled!",Positive
"This is worse than Danny, the chorizo size is like a piece of rice, I had a French onion soup, a chorizo and Friend and a Matcha
The only thing is good is the Matcha, French onion soup it just like chicken broth over one piece of mozzarella cheese , this is overrated. come on! guys be honest this is not a place to eat at all.",Negative
"Absolutely overrated, I have no idea where all the good reviews came from. We got two lattes, the ""signature"" french toast, and the egg breakfast plate. The lattes had coffee grounds in them and tasted like steamed milk. The brioche french toast was topped with burnt walnuts that were visibly black ruining the entire dish. And the breakfast plate was just nothing special with 2 fried eggs, fried potatoes, and a tiny piece of measly sourdough. Had anyone actually came by to check on us and ask us how the meal was, I would have told them all this. The interior and ambiance were really nice and what drew us here, but the food was terrible, and we left most of it behind. Not that anyone who worked there seemed to actually care.",Negative
"Not a good spot. Food isn't good. Decor is nice but doesn't make up for the terrible food or horrible service you'll receive.
Waffle is not actually a waffle but bread pressed into a waffle maker, it actually tasted stale which is crazy!
Chicken was bland and flavorless and whatever the ground meat was was also dry with no flavor.
When I brought this to the waitress' attention she had an attitude. The business owner as well, rude, unprofessional & petty.
I would not recommend this place to anyone, I will never come back.",Negative
"I really wanted to like Sisterita, but unfortunately, our experience was disappointing.

The staff was pretty abrupt and rude from checking in -- we didn't feel welcomed at all, and there was a clear vibe that they wanted to rush us out. It's one thing to be busy, but it's another to make guests feel like an inconvenience/ not wanting to work there.

To top it off, the food didn't quite deliver like we were expecting it to... The potatoes came out cold and French toast had an odd flavor to it- on top of that to add maple syrup it would be an extra 3$ was insane. Being in San francisco for the day, I wish we had breakfast elsewhere.",Negative
"People who dine here have no taste. Because the food simply has no taste.

Dungeness Crab Benedict - salty, sloppy mess. Eggs overcooked and not runny and entirety of eggs/crab/avocado/hollandaise sauce served atop brioche, which could not support the saucy dish. Also, a tomato underneath also added to the wetness/sogginess.

Chicken and waffles - Dry chicken because the restaurant uses chicken breast and not thigh. No flavor in either the chicken or waffle.

Strawberry lemonade - lemonade was not freshly homemade as advertised and the strawberry ""puree"" was watered down. Cheap much?

The whole vibe is a cheap mess. Fake books on the walls, chairs so small you might as well forget about sitting on them and sit on the floor, odd French music even though the food is not French nor Thai (who categorized the food as Thai? Because the owner/staff is? Because the menu has Thai iced tea?).

The host was going back and forth between talking to guests and then answering the restaurant's cellphone, but in either scenario she seemed stressed because she couldn't do either task very well nor was she placing people's names on the waitlist when they checked in.

Although to quote someone in my party ""This is better than Burdell."" And that's not saying much.",Negative
"Place was beautiful, sat at the bar and the barista was wearing a mask and coughing non-stop. You could visibly tell she was actively sick. At one point she took medicine wiped her nose with her hand, and continued to make the drinks without washing her hands. Had this not happened my experience here would have been much more enjoyable. I had them pack out food to go so we could get out of there.",Negative
"Go here if you want to get assaulted by a homeless person outside while you wait in line, follow you into the restaurant, and have the restaurant do absolutely nothing to help you.

They ignored me 4 times when I went inside to tell them there was a man harassing patrons outside before the situation escalated. They literally would not look me in the eyes when I told them what was going on.",Negative
"Stumbled across this place on Yelp and was ecstatic to try this place because of all the reviews praising this establishment. Came here on a Friday around noon and there were only two other tables with diners so we were seated promptly. The waitress with the long hair in a ponytail was really rude and standoffish but we tried to disregard it. I adore the lovely decor with the beautiful bookshelf and elegant design. The only thing I didn't like about the setting was that though it was not too busy and groups of people started trickling in, they still decided to have people seated next to each other which made the dining experience less intimate and very uncomfortable since the tables are extremely close together. When the food came, since we ordered an abundance of items to try, the waitress should've moved us to one of the many empty bigger tables because all the dishes started feeling cluttered and there was no room to eat whatsoever. Even one of the waitresses was confused on where to put some dishes because the table was so small and we had to assist her in rearranging all the dishes and removing some items off the table to get things to fit.

Food:
Pirate Caribbean (2.5/5)- this dish was pretty average and I was expecting the mascarpone to give the eggs a fluffier texture. There was a sufficient amount of crab meat which were really fresh. I did find some crab shells but I just took it as a sign that the crab is fresh.

Steak and eggs (2/5)- My boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs medium rare but it was cooked to a medium and the steak was tough, dry and unseasoned. He considered it an abomination. Lol

French onion soup (1/5)- I don't know how you can burn soup but this was definitely burnt soup.

French toast brioche (4/5)- the only thing we truly enjoyed. It was fluffy, not too sweet and just packing with flavor.

Came excited and left disappointed.",Negative
Our service was a little horrible I ordered French toast with a side of eggs and a side of potato's - the service was a bit slow and we the sides never came out we also didn't receive any syrup. Nope! Not again,Negative
Service is very poor here. They are rude and make it clear they want you out asap while you're eating. I saw them rush multiple tables out during the time we were there including us. This isn't a relaxing brunch place to enjoy coffee and catch up with anyone. It is more like a place in NYC rushing patrons in and out. They also typically have a long line and act like they are doing you a favor by seating you (with or without reservations). The food isn't unique or good enough for that when there's tons of other great brunch places in the area.,Negative
"Things that were wrong with my visit. Waited almost 20 mins for just a cup of coffee and tea. Waited another 30 minutes for our food to arrive, when the food did arrive the chicken was barely warm, slightly burnt, and greasy. The waffle had sugar mixed in the waffle batter, so when I had bites of the waffle all I can taste was the sugar. Unfortunately I will be coming back.",Negative
